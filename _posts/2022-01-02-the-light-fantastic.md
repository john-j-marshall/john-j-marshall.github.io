The Light Fantastic is the second book in the disc world series by Terry Pratchett and the second in the collection 'Unseen University.' Which I now have the pleasure of owning as a lovely Christmas present from my Fiancée. 

The book starts with the ending of the Colour of Magic. The hopeless wizard, Rincewind and the rose-headed tourist, Twoflower falling off the face off the Discworld and into the bottomless fathoms of space, only to be rescued from a source unlooked for and genuinely unexpected. Albeit the rescue seems almost cliche but with the disc world where everything is a caricature and inverted it just works out and strengthens the writing.

The book then gains rapid pace as Rincewind and Twoflower with the help of some new companions, the world’s first great hero, Cohen and his soon to be wife Bethan make their way back to the city of Ankh-Morprok and to Unseen University through a series of events such as stone trolls and druids to try and save the entirety of the disc world.
