The Colour of Magic is the first book set in the Discworld series. I first listened to the Colour of Magic on audio before reading the text myself, and I thoroughly enjoyed both. I discovered after reading this book that the many fans of the series find this book to be a ‘slog’. I did not find this to be the case. 

It’s a wonderful introduction to the Discworld and some colourful characters – namely the hopeless wizard Rincewind, and the tourist Twoflower as they go on a bus man’s holiday of the disc and go through a series of unfortunate events that they (usually) manage to overcome with the help of Twoflower’s mysterious luggage and the odd passing hero. Terry Pratchett has a gift for setting the scene and for introducing characters quickly and building their backstory that lends itself to the story and is not jarring to the reader. 

Overall it is a great read and a good way to introduce anyone to the zany world of the Disc I can only imagine as I can continue to read through the series it will only continue to get better.
