A fascinating read that devlves into the realm of UFO (rebranded the less inflammatory term UAP) and conspicary. The book is rooted with journalistic view with a touch of cyncism to keep the book and narrative grounded while extended to the present day. 

BEGINNING
The book begins with historical evidence of events that have happened were UAP phenoma have been sighted. This opening gives the books a credible voice and lends itself well to establishing the historical facts alongside those found found later in the book.
