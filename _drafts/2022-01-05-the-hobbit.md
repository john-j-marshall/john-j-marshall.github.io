The Hobbit is a classic. This is my Fourth read of the Hobbit even as a children's story it draws me in everytime. The adventures of Bilbo Baggin the hobbit are fantastic. 

The narrator is unknown although I suspect this is Toilkein himself as he tells the story to his children as a bedtime story. The writing is simple and conversational and he has encapsulated the bed time narration perfectly.
